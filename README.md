<p>
Interiorize was built for those who don’t have the knack or time to decorate their homes. Users are sent boxes of items based on their results from our style quiz. The style quiz asks users for their budget, what items they want us to avoid, and their room, style, and color preferences. Based on these responses, the Interiorize API will create the perfect interior design box for that user. Items can range from unique and quirky decor to beautiful art. Interiorize also offers a shop where users can browse through our inventory and purchase anything that captures their eye.

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
Interiorize was designed to function similarly to the popular clothing subscription service, Stitch Fix. But without professional designers on our payroll, we needed to find a way to mock that personalized functionality with just software. To do that we created a mock database of 100 products gathered from Wayfair. These products were organized in a spreadsheet based on style (modern, farmhouse, contemporary, and bohemian) and room. Price, images, description, and brand were collect from these items. Each item was also assigned a color id. This database is the core of Interiorize and allowed us to successfully mock the basic functionality of a personalized subscription service.

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin Dashboard -</strong> If Interiorize needed to be production ready for a business, it would need an admin dashboard. From the admin dashboard, employees would be able to see user's quiz results, recent transactions, and more. 
</li>
<li><strong>Reviews -</strong> Adding functionality for users to be able to review previous orders. Rather than displaying these reviews to the public, this information would go back to the "stylists" to better inform their decisions for the next box.</li>
</ul>
